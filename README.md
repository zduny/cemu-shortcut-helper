## Usage
Download the archive from releases tab, unpack its contents into your Cemu directory (make sure to not create a containing directory - 
`shortcut-helper.exe` has to be in the same directory as `Cemu.exe`).

Internet connection is required for program to work correctly - icons are downloaded from [GameFAQs](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/) website.

Now you have two choices:
 - starting `Create shortcuts - windowed mode.bat` will create shortcuts that will start game in windowed mode,
 - starting `Create shortcuts - fullscreen mode.bat` will create shortcuts that will start game in fullscreen mode.
 
Icons are downloaded into `icons` directory (it will be created in Cemu directory).

Created shortcuts will be placed in `shortcuts` directory (it will be created in Cemu directory).
Yoy may then move them to any location you like (for example: desktop).

Starting program again will overwrite existing files (icons and shortcuts in directories mentioned above).
